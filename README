Key Points:

The project involves using the FLAN-T5 model, a general-purpose language model capable of multiple tasks.
Tokenization converts raw text into numerical embeddings for processing by the model.
Initial attempts using zero-shot inference don't yield desired summaries.
Prompt engineering involves experimenting with different instructions and prompts to guide the model better.
One-shot and few-shot inference help provide additional examples to the model for improved generalization.
Configuration parameters like temperature and sampling influence the creativity and variability of model-generated responses.
The project emphasizes understanding the model's behavior, fine-tuning prompts, and gaining intuition about the language model's capabilities.


1. Objective:
The goal of my project is to develop a generative AI model for dialogue summarization.

2. Data Collection:
I gather a dataset of conversations between people for dialogue summarization.

3. Model Selection:
I choose the FLAN-T5 model, a powerful and versatile language model capable of handling various tasks.

4. Tokenizer:
I use the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the tokenizer, which converts raw text into numerical representations (embeddings).

5. Initial Summarization Attempts:
Initially, I experiment with summarizing conversations using zero-shot inference, but the model's performance is not satisfactory.

6. Prompt Engineering:
I explore different prompts and instructions to improve the summarization. For example, using instructions like "summarize the following conversation" and "dialogue corn."

7. One-Shot and Few-Shot Inference:
I experiment with one-shot and few-shot inference, providing the model with additional examples, including the correct summaries, to help the model generalize better.

8. Temperature and Sampling:
In the final part, I explore different configuration parameters like temperature and sampling to control the creativity and variability of the generated responses.

9. Intuition Building:
Throughout the project, I focus on building intuition about the model's behavior, finding the best prompts, and understanding the impact of different configurations on the summarization output.
